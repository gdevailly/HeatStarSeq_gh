<p>
    To access the application, click on the <strong>Use Application</strong> button on the <strong>top bar</strong>.
	The step-by-step instructions for using the application are below.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Selecting_a_dataset"></a>2.1 Selecting a dataset
</h3>
<p>
    The first step is to <strong>select a dataset</strong> to work with. At the moment, there are 9 datasets available: RNA-seq
	from <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Experiment&assay_title=RNA-seq">ENCODE</a> in human and mouse, from 
    <a href="http://bgee.org/?page=download&action=proc_values">Bgee</a> in human and mouse, from 
	<a href="http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/">BLUEPRINT</a> in human, from <a href="http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/">Roadmap epigenomics</a> in human,
	from <a href="http://gtexportal.org/home/">GTEx</a> in human (available as either a summary dataset or a complete dataset),
	and from <a href="http://flybase.org/">FlyBase</a> in drosophilia.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Loading_an_expression_file"></a>2.2 Loading an expression file
</h3>
<p>
	You can now upload an expression file. Note that this is not mandatory, and you can jump to section
    <a href="#_Static_heatmap">2.4</a> if you simply want to browse the selected dataset. The application accepts a two column tab-delimited text file: the first column 
	should be <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/index.html">Ensembl</a> gene id (ENSG00000134046, ENSMUSG00000024513), or <a href="http://flybase.org/">FlyBase</a>
	for drosophila (FBgn0000003), the second should be the expression value. We
	recommend using Transcript per million (TPM) or Fragment per kilobase pes million (FPKM) metrics. Any additional column
    will not be considered. Please, make sure to untick the <strong>My expression file contains a header</strong> (does first line of the file contains column name?)
	option if your file does not contain a header. You can also fill the <strong>Name of your experiment</strong> field which will
    modify the label of your experiment.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    HeatRNAseq computes Pearson's correlation coefficient between experiments, after scaling them using log10(expression value + 1). Don't upload log-scaled values
	as the application will do it itself.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    The maximum size you can upload is 10 Mb. If your expression file is larger than that, try keeping only the first two columns of it to reduce file size. If
	after removing the non-essential columns the file is still bigger than 10 Mb,
    <a href="mailto:guillaume.devailly%20at%20roslin.ed.ac.uk">contact us</a> (replace at with @).
</p>
<p>
    Once the file is uploaded, a subtle progress bar will appear on top of the page, and quick description of the on-going steps can be found on the top
    right of the page. It should take less than a minute. The <strong>My expression file</strong> tab will display the uploaded gene expression table.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    The easiest way to remove an expression file without uploading a new one is to return to the main page and open a new HeatRNAseq window.
</p>
<p>
	First lines of your file should look like this:
	<table style="width:30%">
	  <tr>
		<th>geneID</th>
		<th>tpm</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>ENSG00000134046</td>
		<td>120.12</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>ENSG00000141644</td>
		<td>0</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>ENSG00000169057</td>
		<td>85.24</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>ENSG00000174282</td>
		<td>0.54</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>ENSG00000187098</td>
		<td>42</td>
	  </tr>
	</table> 
</p>
<p>
	You can download 
	<a href="rnaseq_mouse_GSE70732_NP1071_FPKM_all_genes_with_header.txt" download>this example file</a>.
	It is a mouse brain RNA-seq experiment, kindly provided by Dr. Arbeitman.
	Use a mouse dataset (for example Bgee mouse), and leave the <strong>My expression file contains a header</strong> option ticked.
	It corresponds to the NP1071 sample from 
    <a href= "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70732")>GEO dataset GSE70732</a> 
	supporting <a href="http://www.g3journal.org/content/6/1/221.full">this study</a>.
	It is quite easy to rebuild. From the bottom of the GEO page, download the <strong>GSE70732_Mouse_all_regions_FPKM_data_all_genes.xlsx.gz</strong> file.
	Extract the archive, and open the xlsx file into excel. Keep the first column, and delete all expression columns but the last one (named FPKM_NP1071_GTGGCC_R1),
	and then save the table as a tab-delimited text file. 
</p>

<h3>
    <a name="_Looking_at_the_Correlation_table"></a>2.3 Looking at the Correlation table
</h3>
<p>
	If you have uploaded an expression file, the <strong>Correlation table</strong> tab should now display a 3 column table. The first column contains the name of
    <strong>experiments</strong> in the selected dataset, the second column contains the <strong>correlation</strong> coefficients between the uploaded
    file and the corresponding experiment in the dataset. A third column contains <strong>scaled correlation</strong> values(discussed in
    section <a href="#_Correlation_correction:">2.8</a>); this column is not visible by default. At the bottom of the page, you will find a <strong>Save as tab delimited .txt</strong> download
    button, allowing you to download a copy of the correlation table as a tab delimited text file. The file can be read by many spreadsheet programs
    including Microsoft Excel.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    You can copy an experiment name from the correlation table and paste it into the Search field of the Samples metadata tab to see the metadata available 
    for that experiment.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Static_heatmap"></a>2.4 Static heatmap
</h3>
<p class="text-muted">
    The heatmap can take up to a minute to be displayed, and a bit longer if you are importing a new expression file or switching datasets.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>static heatmap</strong> tab will display a clustered heatmap representation of the correlation matrix: each row and column represent a single
    experiment. The colour legend can be found below the heatmap: white represents a correlation coefficient equal to 0,
    red equals to 0.5, and black equals to 1. Several options are available on the side bar panel on the left, <strong>3 - Plot customization</strong>. In the
    order of appearance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>Highlight my experiment in the heatmap</strong> tick box. When checked, if you uploaded an expression file, the row and line corresponding to your
        experiment will be highlighted: a 0 correlation value will be displayed in yellow, a 0.5 value in bright green, and a 1 correlation value still in
        black. This can help you localise your experiment in crowded heatmaps.
    </li>
    <li>
        One or several <strong>subset</strong> options: You can restrict the experiments to be displayed using those fields. They may vary a bit between
		datasets. You can select experiments done in one or several
        <strong>cell types</strong>. Leaving the field empty will select all experiments.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="text-muted">
    If less than three experiments from the dataset match your criteria, the heatmap will not be displayed. You can look for available experiments in the Samples metadata tab.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    The uploaded expression file is not affected by the filters and will always be displayed in the heatmap.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
		The function of the <strong>Uploaded experiment correlation correction</strong> field and the <strong>Maximum expected correlation value for linear scaling correction 
		</strong>slider is explained in section <a href="#_Correlation_correction:">2.8</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
		The <strong>Advanced clustering options</strong> button will reveal the <strong>Distance calculation</strong> and <strong>Clustering method</strong> options.
		The selected values are passed to the R <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/dist.html">dist()</a>
		and <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/hclust.html">hclust()</a> method parameter. A special case is the
        <strong>1 - Pearson's correlation coefficient</strong> distance method: instead of using the dist() function on correlation values, it uses 1 - correlations as a measure of
        distance between experiments (a correlation of 0.75 will give a distance of 0.25).
    </li>
	<li>
       Label and margin size can be decided manually: The <strong>Sample name size</strong> slider will modify label size.
	   The <strong>Sample name margin</strong> will modify the size of the margin of the plot.
	   Two scrolling menus will allow to show and hide row and/or column dendrograms and sample labels.
    </li>
    <li>
		The <strong>Customise colour</strong> button will revealed items allowing to change the colour key used for the heatmap.
		Four threshold values and associated colours can be specified (by default, 0.25 is blue, 0.5 is white, 0.75 is red, and 1 is black).
		Values need to be strictly increasing. To apply changes, click the <strong>Apply colour changes</strong> button.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="text-muted">
    If you see an error message: <strong>Figure margins too large</strong>, try reducing the size of the margin as well as the size of the labels.
</p>
<p>
    Buttons <strong>Save as png</strong>, <strong>Save as pdf</strong> and <strong>Save as svg</strong> can be found below the heatmap to export the
    image in those formats. Button <strong>Export data as tab delimited .txt</strong> exports the heatmap data as a text file. To download the colour key,
	right click on it and select <strong>Save Image As...</strong>
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Responsive_heatmap"></a>2.5 Responsive heatmap
</h3>
<p>
    The <strong>responsive heatmap </strong>tab displays an interactive plot provided through the <a href="https://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a> API. It can take about a 
	minute to be displayed on powerful computer running recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet explorer
    or Edge web browsers. It represents the same version of the <strong>Static heatmap</strong> presented in the previous section, without the side
    dendrograms (trees). Most of the options are the same as for <strong>Static heatmap</strong>, so please check section <a href="#_Static_heatmap">2.4</a>
    for more information. Additional options are available on the responsive heatmap itself:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Mouse over information: when hovering the mouse over the heatmap, a text box will appear, giving you the name of the experiment in the x-axis, the
    name of the experiment in the y-axis, and their correlation value (z).
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="text-muted">
    If the Highlight my experiment in the heatmap option is enabled, the z value of the highlighted cells will be offset by 2: a correlation value of 0.75 will
    have a z-value of 2.75.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
		One can zoom on the heatmap by dragging and dropping the mouse defining a rectangle. To zoom out, double-click on the heatmap or click the
		<strong>Reset axis</strong> or <strong>Autoscale</strong> buttons on the top left corner of the heatmap.
	</li>
    <li>
        By selecting the <strong>Pan</strong> button on the top left corner of the heatmap, dragging and dropping the mouse will allow to pan, which can be
        useful once you have zoomed in a specific part of the heatmap.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Download plot as a png</strong> button seems non-functional (blame plot.ly). Please use the one under the <strong>Static heatmap</strong> or
        look at the next step.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Save and edit plot in the cloud</strong> will send the data to <a href="https://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a> where, after the loading, one can play with many tools offered by
        plot.ly, such as export a JSON version of the data, save the plot as a png, change the theme (and notably the colour scale), etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a name="_Tree"></a>2.6 Tree
</h3>
<p>
    The <strong>Tree</strong> tab will display only the dendrogram (or Tree) from the experiment clustering. Options are mostly similar to the one for static
    heatmap, please refer to section <a href="#_Static_heatmap">2.4</a>. The <strong>Highlight my experiment in the heatmap</strong>
    option will not highlight your experiment in the dendrogram.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    If you see a red, unfriendly error message: <strong>Figure margins too large</strong>, try reducing the size of the margin as well as the name size.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Pairwise_plot"></a>2.7 Pairwise plot
</h3>
<p>
	The <strong>Pairwise plot</strong> tab will display scatter plot of two selected experiments where each dot represents a gene.
	Under the <strong>Plot customisation</strong> section on the left of the page, you can:
<ul>
	<li> choose experiment 1 and experiment 2.</li>
	<li> choose the plot type, between XY (where x-axis will be expression level in experiment 1, and y-axis expression level in experiment 2) and MA 
	(where x-axis will be mean expression level, and y-axis expression level in experiment 1 minus expression level in experiment 2).</li>
	<li> choose a different scaling to apply to the expression data. By default, if e is the expression level, HeatRNAseq apply log10(e + 1) before computing the Pearson
	correlation coefficient. You can select different scaling here to see the impact on the Pearson correlation coefficient.
	<li> add or remove a linear regression line (blue).
	<li> add or remove a guide line (red), which will be y=x in XY plot, and y=0 in MA plot.</li>
</ul>
	Below the scatterplot should be the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between the two experiments, computed after the scaling.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    Spearman correlation coefficient is independent of the scaling, are scaling method proposed here do not change the order of the data.
	All log transformation of the data have the same Pearson correlation coefficient as log in one base is a linear transformation of log in a different base.
</p>
<p>
	Further bellow are buttons to download the scatter plot as png, pdf or svg (recommended), as well as export a tabulated text file containing the data used for making
	the scatterplot.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Samples_metadata"></a>2.8 Sample metadata
</h3>
<p>
	The sample metadata tab will display metadata information (experience name, cell type, url of the original data, etc.) for the <strong>selected dataset</strong>.
	The table is sortable and searchable, and can be downloaded as a tab-delimited txt file using the <strong>save</strong>
    button below the table.
</p>
<p>
    You can copy an experiment name from the correlation table and paste it into the Search field of the Samples metadata tab to learn all the metadata we have
    for that experiment.
</p>
<h3>
    <a name="_Correlation_correction:"></a>2.9 Correlation correction
</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes, the maximum correlation of a user peak file with any experiment in the dataset can be quite low. In some cases, when the user is confident
    that the top hits are relevant, this may be evidence of strong "batch effect" that could reflect an artefact of library preparation method, quantification method or
	RNA integrity. The low correlation values might bias the clustering due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_branch_attraction">Long Branch Attraction</a>.
	We provide an option to correct for his bias using the <strong>Linear scaling</strong> method on the <strong>Uploaded experiment correlation correction</strong> option.
	The correlation values will be linearly	up-scaled so the maximum correlation value will now be equal to the value of the
    <strong>Maximum expected correlation value for linear scaling correction </strong>slider (default 0.95). The resulting transformed correlation value can be
    obtained from the <strong>scaledCorrelation</strong> column of the <strong>Correlation table</strong>.
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    The linear scaling of correlation value will not change the ordering of the values, only scales the value (i.e. the third most correlated experiment without scaling
	will still be third with scaling).
